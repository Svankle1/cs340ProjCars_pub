# cs340ProjCars
Project for CS340 that has to do with managing a database made to track car collections
This code is based on the CS 340 starter code. Development did branch out from the starter code quite a lot, (Such as but not limited to: the implementation of routing and making multiple queries before rendering a site, as well as making queries for non page rendering requests). The 340 NodeJS starter code was used as a framework, and we think that our efforts are more accuretally described as "building off of" rather than "copying".
Not all original work is highlited. An effort was made, but only after all work was done.# cs340ProjCars_pub
